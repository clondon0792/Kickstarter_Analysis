# Kickstarter Analysis

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to provide information to Louise on how the different campaigns performed in relation to the launch dates and funding goals. This data shall summarize how the funding goal and launch date corresponds to the success or failure of the project. Thus, giving the client a verbose insight on how to proceed with their future campaigns.

##	Analysis and Challenges
Analysis of the outcomes relative to their launch dates signifies that the two most successful months of the year to launch a theater Kickstarter campaign, is between May and June. A filter was used to determine the most successful times of year that a theater Kickstarter was created. May had the most successful campaigns with a total of 111. June was the second most successful month of the year with 100 successful campaigns.

Analysis of the outcomes relative to their desired goals signifies that a goal is more likely to be met, when the goal is set at a much lower number. The graph below directly shows the relation between the larger the number for a set goal, the less likely the project will succeed.

It can be deduced that with a higher goal being set, the less likely the project is to reach its intended goal. It can also be determined that goals that are less than 1000 will have a much higher chance of reaching their intended goal. 

The challenge faced when putting together this information was determining exactly what Louise would most want to know about and what is most relevant to the topic at hand. Knowing that she has attempted to begin her own Kickstarter campaign that had come close to achieving its goal, provided the details needed to allow the most pertinent information to be given to Louise.

## Results
To summarize, the two conclusions that can be drawn from the Outcomes based on the Launch Date are that the best time of year for a theater Kickstarter is between the months of May and June. The time that seems to be the most detrimental for theater Kickstarterâ€™s, is between December and January. What can be understood from the Outcomes based on Goals is that the lower the set goal typically is, the more likely for success for that given project. The higher the initial goal is set for the Kickstarter, the less likely for that specific Kickstarter to succeed. With these two datasets there is no way to understand the demographic and direct location of where each event was held and how to capitalize on those metrics. In the subcategory of a theater Kickstarter, it can be determined that the most successful variation between plays, musicals and spaces: was plays. Another graph that could be used to further realize this point, is to provide the Subcategory Outcomes graph that signifies that of all subcategories, plays have the greatest level of success.
